My very first repository, ever.

My name is Garrett Lee Graham Anderson. I was born and raised in Central Florida and I love my home state. Although Florida will always be home, I wish to travel. I hope to be able to ultimately live and work abroad. I am a classivally trained violinist and I love music of various genres. I try to find the beauty in life and I hope to enhance my creativity with practical knowledge so as to, not only make a comfortable living but, help improve the lives of others.

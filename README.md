My very first repository, ever...

My name is Garrett Lee Graham Anderson. I was born and raised in Central Florida and I love the Sunshine State. Although Florida will always be home, I wish to travel. I hope to be able to, ultimately, live and work abroad. 

I am a classically-trained violinist and I love music of various genres. I try to find the beauty in life and I hope to enhance my creativity through practical knowledge so as to not only provide for myself a comfortable living but to help improve the lives of others.

I received a BA from Stetson University, class of 2011. I graduated with a major in Humanities and minors in Business and French, while studying the violin at the School of Music. I really enjoyed what I studied during my four years at Stetson. Considering that I hated the major I declared prior to Humanities (International Business), changing my academic focus was one of the best decisions I've ever made. And, I cannot express enough my desire to travel the world in its entirety. I love the idea of a *bucket list,* and I hope that my list will be extensive in length before I depart this realm of existence.

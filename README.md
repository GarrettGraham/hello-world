My very first repository, ever...

My name is Garrett Lee Graham Anderson. I was born and raised in Central Florida and I love the Sunshine State. Although Florida will always be home, I wish to travel. I hope to be able to, ultimately, live and work abroad. 

I am a classically-trained violinist and I love music of various genres. I try to find the beauty in life and I hope to enhance my creativity through practical knowledge so as to not only provide for myself a comfortable living but to help improve the lives of others.
